\usage{
fieldShape(
  mosaic,
  ncols = 10,
  nrows = 10,
  nPoint = 4,
  fieldMap = NULL,
  fieldData = NULL,
  ID = NULL,
  theta = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  fast.plot = FALSE,
  extent = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mosaic}{object of class stack obtained from function \code{\link{fieldRotate}} with the base of image parallel to axis X.}

\item{ncols}{number of ranges.}

\item{nrows}{number of rows.}

\item{nPoint}{number of points necessary to select field boundaries or area to remove (4 >= nPoint <= 50).}

\item{fieldMap}{matrix with plots ID identified by rows and ranges, please use first the funsction \code{\link{fieldMap}}.}

\item{fieldData}{data frame with plot ID and all attributes of each plot (Traits as columns and genotypes as rows).}

\item{ID}{name of plot ID in the fieldData file to combine with fieldShape.}

\item{theta}{angle of rotation used on function \code{\link{fieldRotate}}. It is an important step to fit the fieldShape on the original image.}

\item{plot}{if is TRUE the crop image and fieldShape will be plotted.}

\item{fast.plot}{if TRUE only the grey scale image will be plotted as reference (faster approach).}

\item{extent}{if is TRUE the entire image area will be the fieldShape (one unique plot).}
}
\value{
A list with two element
\itemize{
  \item \code{mosaic} new mosaic cropped with the drew \code{fieldshape}.
  \item \code{fieldShape} The function returns the \code{fieldShape} format 
  \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} with plots numbered from left to right and top to bottom, 
  and a new reduced image with format stack. The \code{fieldMap} can be used to identify the plot ID.
}
}
\description{
The user should select the four experimental field corners and the shape file with plots will be automatcly 
built using a grid with the number of ranges and rows. Attention: The base of image should be parallel to axis X, 
please use first the function \code{\link{fieldRotate}}.
