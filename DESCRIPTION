Description: A compilation of functions to analyze orthomosaic images 
  from research fields. To prepare the image it first allows to crop the image, remove soil 
  and weeds and rotate the image. The package also builds a plot shapefile in order to extract 
  information for each plot to evaluate different wavelengths, vegetation indices, stand count, 
  canopy percentage, and plant height.
